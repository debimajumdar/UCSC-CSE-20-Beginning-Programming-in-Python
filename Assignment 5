Write a program that reads a list of words. Then, the program outputs those words and their frequencies (case insensitive).

CODE:
a = input()
mylist = a.split()
for i in range(0, len(mylist)):
    count = 1
    for j in range(0, len(mylist)):
        if i != j:
            if mylist[i].lower() == mylist[j].lower():
                count +=1
    print(mylist[i], count)

LAB 8.21.1
A contact list is a place where you can store a specific contact with other associated information such as a phone number, email address,
birthday, etc. Write a program that first takes in word pairs that consist of a name and a phone number (both strings), separated by a comma. 
That list is followed by a name, and your program should output the phone number associated with that name. Assume the search name is always in the list.

CODE:
input1 = input().split(sep=" ")

for i in range(len(input1)):
    input1[i] = input1[i].split(sep=",")

input2 = input()

for x in input1:
    if x[0] == input2:
        print(x[1])
        break

LAB 8.29.1
Write a program to calculate the total price for car wash services. A base car wash is $10. 
A dictionary with each additional service and the corresponding cost has been provided. Two additional services can be selected.
A '-' signifies an additional service was not selected. Output all selected services, according to the input order, along with the corresponding 
costs and then the total price for all car wash services.

CODE:
services = { 'Air freshener' : 1 , 'Rain repellent': 2, 'Tire shine' : 2, 'Wax' : 3, 'Vacuum' : 5 }
base_wash = 10
total = 0

service_choice1 = input()
service_choice2 = input()
p1 = 0
p2 = 0
print('ZyCar Wash')
print('Base car wash -- $'+str(base_wash))

if service_choice1 != '-':
    p1 = services[service_choice1]
    print(service_choice1+str(' -- $')+str(p1))

if service_choice2 != '-':
    p2 = services[service_choice2]
    print(service_choice2+str(' -- $')+str(p2))

print('----')

total = base_wash + p1 + p2

print('Total price: $'+str(total))
