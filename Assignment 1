LAB 1.18.1 For each of the following steps, end the program's output with a newline.


(1) Write a program that outputs the following. (Submit for 1 point).
Hello world!

(2) Update to output the following. (Submit again for 1 more point, so 2 points total).
Hello world!
How are you? 

(3) Finally, update to output the following. (Submit again for 1 more point, so 3 points total).
Hello world!
How are you?
   (I'm fine).
 
CODE:
 
print('Hello world!')
print('How are you?')
print ("   (I'm fine).")

LAB 1.20.1
A variable like user_num can store a value like an integer. Extend the given program as indicated.
Output the user's input. (2 pts)
Output the input squared and cubed. Hint: Compute squared as user_num * user_num. (2 pts)
Get a second user input into user_num2, and output the sum and product. (1 pt)

CODE:

user = int(input('Enter integer:\n'))
print('You entered:', user)
print(user ,'squared is', user*user)
print('And', user, 'cubed is', user*user*user, '!!')
user2 = int(input('Enter another integer:\n'))
print(user, '+', user2, 'is', user+user2)
print(user, '*', user2, 'is', user*user2)

LAB 1.21.1 
 Output this tree. (Submit for 2 points).

   *
  ***
 *****
*******
  ***

(2) Below the tree (with two blank lines), output this cat. (Submit for 3 points, so 5 points total).

/\   /\
  o o
 =   =
  ---
  
 CODE:
 print('   *')
print('  ***')
print(' *****')
print('*******')
print('  ***\n\n')
print('/\\   /\\')
print('  o o')
print(' =   =')
print('  ---')

LAB 2.12.1
Write a program that reads integers user_num and div_num as input, and outputs user_num divided by div_num three times using floor divisions.

CODE:
user_num = int(input())
div_num = int(input())
z = user_num//div_num
y = z//div_num
x = y//div_num
print(z, y, x)

LAB 2.14.1
The following equation estimates the average calories burned for a person when exercising, which is based on a scientific journal article (source):

Calories = ( (Age x 0.2757) + (Weight x 0.03295) + (Heart Rate x 1.0781) â€” 75.4991 ) x Time / 8.368

Write a program using inputs age (years), weight (pounds), heart rate (beats per minute), and time (minutes), respectively. Output the average calories burned for a person.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'Calories: {calories:.2f} calories')

CODE:
age = int(input())
weight = int(input())
heart_rate = int(input())
time = int(input())



cal = ( (age * 0.2757) + (weight * 0.03295) + (heart_rate * 1.0781) - 75.4991 ) * time/ 8.368

print('Calories: ', end='')

print(f'{cal:.2f}' , end='')

print(' calories')
