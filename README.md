# UCSC-CSE-20-Beginning-Programming-in-Python
My work for the lab assignments for Cormac Flanagan's CSE 20 Introduction To Python Class at UCSC.

CSE 20
This course provides students with Python programming skills and the ability to design programs and read Python code. Topics include data types, control flow, methods and functions, built-in data structures, and introduction to Object-Oriented Programming. No prior programming experience is required.

Many thanks to Professor Benedict Paten for permission to re-use his course materials.

 

FINAL EXAM: Tuesday Dec 6,  4-7pm in the usual classroom.

 

Quick Homework Due Dates Summary:

There are three types of homework: Zybooks Readings, Lecture Quizzes, and Zybooks Programming Assignments.
There is a Zybooks Reading and Lecture Quiz for each lecture (except the midterm).
Each Zybooks Reading and Lecture Quiz is due at 11:59 pm on Monday after it is set. e.g. a reading/quiz set during the Mon/Wed/Fri classes is due at 11:59 pm on the following Monday
There is one Zybooks Programming Assignment per week. It is due a week on Monday at 11:59 pm.
Strict but fair: Late submissions get penalized at our discretion without a valid reason - e.g. medical note, etc. Current policy is you get 80% of points if you submit late.

Learning Support Services (LSS):
There is tutoring available for this class provided by Learning Support Services (LSS)! 
Small Group Tutoring is for everyone and open to all students in class to get extra practice on the things you already know or the things you want to know better. One-hour SGT sessions are offered at least three times each week for the entire quarter. Your tutor(s) is an undergraduate student who took the class, did well, and received extensive training on how to support you in the course. Sessions are available several days a week and attendance is voluntary; however, students who attend sessions weekly tend to earn a higher final grade than students who do not participate.

Ask your tutor for more information about session times, visit our website, or visit us in person at the ARCenter or remotely at our Virtual Front Desk Links to an external site., M-F 9am-6pm. You can also view your Tutorâ€™s schedule on The Tutor Hub.Links to an external site.

Important Dates:

Friday, September 30th -- Students can sign up for tutoring (some may have access sooner based on priority groups)
Sunday, October 2nd -- Sessions begin
 

Course Objectives:
The goal for students in this class is to learn the basics of computer programming and debugging using the Python language.  Students completing this course should be able to:

Be able to solve small programming problems in Python using good programming style.
Demonstrate familiarity with standard Python types including strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries.
Be able to break a program into small functions.
Be able to debug small programs.
Be familiar with the Python control constructs: conditionals, loops, and iterators.
Be able to create simple classes and objects.
Prerequisite(s):
There are no prerequisites for this class, other than intellectual curiosity (very important!), knowledge of math at the pre-calculus level, and a desire to learn how to program. No prior programming experience is required. Further, if you have had significant formal programming experience this is the wrong class for you, even if you do want to learn Python.

 

Textbook (mandatory): 
We are using an online textbook that provides test examples and tutorials which will augment the lecture materials. To access this:

Subscribe

A subscription is $34.50. Students may begin subscribing on Sep 03, 2022 and the cutoff to subscribe is Dec 10, 2022. Subscriptions will last until Jan 03, 2023. Readings and exercises and programming assignments will use ZyBooks.  For each lecture there is an associated "Reading" - see the assignments tab of Zybooks. Readings have a due date on the next Monday following the lecture and consist of reading and participation activities. In addition, there is a weekly "Programming Assignment", due the following Monday after it is set. All Zybooks Programming Assignments and Readings are due at 11:59 pm on their due date. Unless permission is explicitly gained, late submissions will get penalized.
In addition, you may use the free open textbook "How to think like a computer scientist": http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/

This free textbook is useful as an additional source, with some additional content not covered by the lectures of Zybooks.

Course Policies:
Exams
There will be a midterm and a final examination. You must take each exam at the scheduled time unless you are seriously ill or have an unexpected family emergency. You must let the professor know by email or text message before the exams scheduled start unless you are physically unable to send a message, and you must provide a doctor's note or letter from the funeral home before you can make up the exam. There are no exceptions to this policy.

Academic Honesty Policy Summary
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated in any form. We do run plagiarism detection software on all submissions and will take action in all detected cases. It is essential that you work on the assignments on your own. This means that:

You may not show or share your code with anyone other than TAs or tutors -  you may discuss the conceptual design / how you solved it with others - just don't directly share/show your code.
You may not post code or questions from your project online to ask others for help. This means anywhere online, including Discord (ask us in person!), independent message boards (e.g., StackExchange, Chegg (ugh)) and file sharing sites.
You must cite all sources of aid (other than course staff, course textbook, course website, and material on python.org and jetbrains.com), including the group of people you discussed your design with in anything you submit, even if the source is considered acceptable.
Diversity and Inclusivity Statement
UC Santa Cruz is committed to creating an academic environment that supports its diverse student body. If you are a student with a disability who requires accommodations to achieve equal access in this course, please submit your Accommodation Authorization Letter from the Disability Resource Center (DRC) to me privately, preferably within the first two weeks of the quarter. I encourage all students who may benefit from learning more about DRC services to contact DRC by phone at 831-459-2089, or by email at drc@ucsc.edu.
